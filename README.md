# R_projects

This Repository contains all the projects I worked on while taking a Data Analysis with R course on Dataquest and other projects on R. These projects include:

# 1. Exploratory Visualization of Forest fire Data

The aim of this project was to visualize the forest fire data and gain insights as to how often forest fires occured, and places they occurred most.

# 2. Investigating Covid'19 Virus Trends

The aim of this project was to answer this **question: Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?**
